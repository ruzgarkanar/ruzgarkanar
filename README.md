  <h3 style="color: #264653;">WeObserve Open Data Challenge Award</h3>
  <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Addressing climate challenges requires help from everyone, and Citizen Observatories aspire to deeply engage citizens to gather data and information about the environment to support better decision-making, new services and make change.</p>
  <p>WeObserve opened data from four Citizen Observatories to create new digital transformation opportunities by using open data for products and services that can be implemented for wider social good. There were a few key events that made up our Open Data Challenge:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Team registration</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Consent for access to online datasets</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Challenge themes and opportunities</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Guidance from a mentor</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Submission and demonstration at a final event</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>All submissions were judged on excellence across three criteria: <strong>Solution and Data</strong>, <strong>Concept</strong>, and <strong>Team and Market</strong>. According to these criteria, the judging panel concluded on the two winners.</p>
  <p>The two winning teams will take part and present their projects at the <strong>WeObserve Conference</strong> that will take place on 14-15 October 2020.</p>
